# PHASE_1 PROJECT.

## Overview

### Business Understanding.

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films that are currently doing the best at the box office. I will then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Film production is very expensive but it can be very profitable when the movie produced entices the targeted audience.This project aims to explore the kind of movies that are doing well at the box office, and reccommend those types of films to the head of Microsoft's new movie studio.
